# Time Series EDA

## Overview
This project focuses on **Time Series Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using financial or stock market data, specifically for NVIDIA (NVDA). The goal is to analyze temporal trends, perform resampling operations, and visualize key insights.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure and distribution of time series data.
- **Time Resampling:** Aggregate and manipulate data at various time granularities (e.g., daily, monthly).
- **Visualizations:** Generate insightful plots to identify trends and patterns.

## Visualizations
The project includes various plots, such as:
- **Line Charts:** Display trends over time (e.g., stock prices, volume).
- **Resampled Trends:** Show aggregated metrics over different time intervals (e.g., weekly averages).
- **Customized Axes:** Use date formatting to prevent overlapping and improve readability.

## Python Packages Used
- Pandas , Matplotlib, yfinance , Panda-datareader

## Results
- Resampled data insights (e.g., weekly/monthly trends).
- Clear visualizations for understanding stock behavior.
